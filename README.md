A collection of classification projects built with Scikit learn or implemented from scratch in Python.

Some of the projects are built upon projects in the classification class I took on Coursera from UW.

#### [Classify Amazon review data](https://github.com/ExLupi/Classification_projects_in_Python/blob/master/1_Amazon_reviews/LogisticRegression_AmazonReview.ipynb)


Predict whether a review is positive or negative with bag-of-word features and logistic regression.

- extracted bag-of-word features with CountVectorizer in scikit learn
- compared two classification models: classify with the sign of score or a logit link
- compared the effect of vocabulary size on classifying Amazon review data
- benchmarked with majority-class classifier


#### [Training logistic regression models with gradient ascent and regularizations from scratch](https://github.com/ExLupi/Classification_projects_in_Python/blob/master/2_GradientDescent_for_LogReg/LogisticRegression_gradientdescent_regularization.ipynb) 

- implemented logistic regression with gradient descent algorithm from scratch
- performed sentiment analysis on curated Amazon review data
- explored effects of regularization with logistic regression
