A collection of classification projects built with Scikit learn or implemented from scratch in Python.

Some of the projects are built upon projects in the classification class I took on Coursera from UW.

#### Classify Amazon review data


Predict whether a review is positive or negative with bag-of-word features and logistic regression.

- extracted bag-of-word features with CountVectorizer in scikit learn
- compared two classification models: classify with the sign of score or a logit link
- compared the effect of vocabulary size on classifying Amazon review data
- benchmarked with majority-class classifier


#### Training logistic regression models with gradient ascent and regularizations from scratch 

- implemented logistic regression with gradient descent algorithm from scratch
- performed sentiment analysis on curated Amazon review data
- explored effects of regularization with logistic regression
